These are my dot files. I am there leader. 
.vimrc has my vim settings. I took the vimrc file off of some guys site.
.bashrc has my aliases. I don't have any right now because I reformatted my computer and lost my old virtual machine. I don't use aliases enough right now to really warrent me adding them back in :P.
config has some shortcuts for the servers I frequent.
.gitconfig has some aliases and other configuration stuff for git.
